# 📝 Logistic Regression - NLP Kaggle Competition

A **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project applying **Logistic Regression** to text classification. This project was part of a **Kaggle competition**, where we used **machine learning techniques** for sentiment analysis and text categorization.

---

## 📌 Features
✅ **Preprocessing of Text Data** (Tokenization, Vectorization)  
✅ **Logistic Regression Model** for text classification  
✅ **Feature Scaling & Normalization** with StandardScaler  
✅ **Model Persistence** using Joblib for reusability  
✅ **Submission File for Kaggle Competition**  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Logistic Regression, Preprocessing)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **Joblib** (Saving and Loading Models)
- **Kaggle** (Dataset & Competition Submission)
